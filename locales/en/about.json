    "description":"A frontend-focused developer with a deep passion for crafting fast, accessible, and well-structured user interfaces using modern tools like Next.js and TypeScript. I pay close attention to design details and strive to create UI experiences that are smooth, responsive, and user-centered.\nOver the past few years, I’ve contributed to building dashboards, marketing websites, and e-commerce platforms — always aiming for performance, clarity, and reusability in every component I develop.\nI also have a solid understanding of backend technologies such as Nest js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, gained through personal projects. This allows me to better understand the full development workflow and streamline integration between frontend and backend layers.\nCurrently, I’m working on a personal tech product that reflects my approach to building meaningful and high-quality digital experiences. I’m constantly looking to grow professionally and contribute to impactful, user-first projects."
